This shall be the beginning of my blogging journey. I am very excited to be a part of the Ste\|\|ar Group (http://stellar.cct.lsu.edu/projects/hpx/) through the Google Summer of Code Program 2017 (https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) . For the foreseeable future, this blog shall only include development content pertaining to GSoC.

The project I will be working on is HPXCL (https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxcl), in which I shall aim to introduce 'Event' based mechanism in the process of seamless blending of CUDA with HPX asynchronous graph and write a few benchmarking algorithms for measuring the performance of the library as a whole. I aim to submit a research paper to a reputable conference at the end of this program.

Following shall be the content to be documented using this blog Site.
1. Summary of any research paper read
2. Considered designs/technology decisions
3. Coding progress
4. Any errors encountered
5. Anything else that I feel is necessary ;)

Last but not the least, I need to find a better editor than stackedit.io for writing in markup style.
